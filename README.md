# Camera_Slider
## A firmware to Drive a Cam slider
### Description
Code for motion and direction control of 2 stepper motors using a joystick.
For motor control, we use the [Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library.git).
### Components
- Arduino Nano
- Joystick
- 2 Stepper Motors
- L293D Motor Shield

### Configuration
**Stepper Motors**
Depending on the motor, the number of steps per revolution must be set. For this project, motors with a step angle of 1.8Â° were used, for which the number of steps is 200. This section is configured in the following line of code.
```
AF_Stepper motor1(200, 1);
```
**Joystick**
To define the operating zone of the joystick, the zero point and a range of inactivity must be determined to avoid unwanted activations.
